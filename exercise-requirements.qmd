# Exercise Requirements {.unnumbered}

## R Packages

If you use `{renv}` to manage package dependencies in your projects, you can visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/arnold-c/SISMID-Module-02_2024) for this project and download the ***renv.lock***, ***.Rprofile***, and ***renv/activate.R*** files, before running the command `renv::restore()`.
Alternatively, if you already use GitHub, you could clone the project and just run `renv::restore()`.

If you would prefer to just install the packages manually to avoid the complications associated with using `{renv}`, you can install the packages printed below.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages(c(
    "tidyverse",
    "deSolve",
    "diagram",
    "gt",
    "ggtext",
    "here",
    "rio"
))
```

## Data Files

To complete the exercises, some data files are required.
The exercises should load the datafiles via urls, but if you would prefer to download them to your own machine, your are welcome to do so.
To download the files, go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/arnold-c/SISMID-Module-02_2023) and download the files in the `data/` folder of your repository.
You should then uncomment the lines of code that run `...  <- rio::import(here::here("data", ...))`, and comment out the lines that include the URLs.
