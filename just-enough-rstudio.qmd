# Just Enough RStudio {.unnumbered}

There are a number of features in RStudio that will make your life easier.
This section aims to highlight a few of them.

## RStudio projects

RStudio gives you the ability to turn a directory (that you are hopefully using to contain all your project, as [mentioned in the next section](project-management.qmd#project-structure)), into an *RStudio project*.
One of the benefits of using *RStudio projects* is that you can easily switch between different projects and RStudio will start a new `R` session, meaning that objects you created in your first project won't stick around, causing issues by existing in a place where they shouldn't.
The other key benefit is that you can use the `{here}` package to create relative file paths, for easier code sharing and increased reproducibility.
See [this section](project-management.qmd#here-package) for more details about the `{here}` package.

To create a new RStudio projet, simply open up RStudio, and click on the *"Project: (None)"* button in the top right corner.

You will then be given the option to create the project in a *"New Directory"*, and *"Existing Directory"*, or from *"Version Control"*.
If you've already created a project just for this workshop, then select *"Existing Directory"*, otherwise, create a new one.
If you know about Git, then please feel free to use the last option, but options 1 & 2 are most relevant for new users.
Either way, we'd recommend reading through our [project organization tips](project-management.qmd#project-structure) about what this directory should look like/include.
If you select *"New Directory"*, you probably want to select *"New Project"* on the next option, unless you have something specific in mind (like a *"Quarto Book"*, which is used for this website!).

Finally, choose the directory name and location, and you're in business (you should click the button in the bottom-left corner to *"Open in new session"* to make sure you're starting in a fresh environment).
From here on out, when you open up a project, all the files you've created will be easily accessibly, both from the *"Files"* pane, as well as using [relative paths](project-management.qmd#here-package).

::: {.callout-tip}
To reiterate our comments from the [project organization tips](project-management.qmd#project-structure) page, it's useful to have all your project directories in a single location on your computer, and make sure you do not have any spaces in the file or folder names.

## RStudio keyboard shortcuts

There are many shortcuts available to RStudio users, but here are the key ones:

| Shortcut  | Command |
|--------|--------|
| `cmd/ctrl + enter`  | Send the section of code to the console to be run   |
| `cmd/ctrl + opt/alt + r`  | Run all code |
| `cmd/ctrl + opt/alt + b`  | Run all code from beginning to selected line |
| `cmd/ctrl + shift + enter`  | Run current chunk (when within a `Rmd` or `Quarto` notebook) |
| `cmd/ctrl + shift + p`  | Open the command palette (a place where you can search for different commands) |
| `cmd/ctrl + shift + a`  | Reformat selected code (useful to help keep things readable) |
| `cmd/ctrl + shift + c`  | Comment the selected lines |
| `cmd/ctrl + shift + m`  | Insert the pipe (`%>%`) operator (or `|>` if you have set up RStudio to use the base pipe by default)|
| `opt/alt + -`  | Insert the assignment operator (`<-`) |

The common shortcuts for saving and opening files/selecting all etc. also exist in RStudio with the standard keybindings.

To see the full list of keyboard shortcuts, you can go to *"Tools > Keyboard Shortcuts Help"*.
