    "text": "7.2 A Model With 2 Age Classes\nNote that age is a special kind of heterogeneity in an epidemic model because individuals necessarily move from one class (younger) to another class (older) in a directional fashion that is independent of the infection and recovery process.\n\n\n\nWe’ll start by introducing age into the model above. So now \\(a\\) becomes juveniles and \\(b\\) becomes adults. And, independent of the disease process, juveniles (of any category) age into adults. Additionally, new juveniles are added through births (always first susceptible) and old individuals are lost to death.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can do this very simply using the same ingredients that go into the basic SIR model. In that model, the waiting times in the S and I classes are exponential. Let’s assume the same thing about the aging process. We’ll also add in births into the juvenile susceptible class and deaths from the adult classes.\n\\[\n  \\begin{aligned}\n    \\frac{dS_J}{dt} &= B -\\lambda_J\\,S_J \\phantom{- \\gamma\\,I_A} -\\alpha\\,S_J \\phantom{-\\mu\\,S_A}\\\\\n    \\frac{dS_A}{dt} &= \\phantom{B} - \\lambda_A\\,S_A \\phantom{- \\gamma\\,I_A} +\\alpha\\,S_J -\\mu\\,S_A\\\\\n    \\frac{dI_J}{dt} &= \\phantom{B} +\\lambda_J\\,S_J - \\gamma\\,I_J -\\alpha\\,I_J \\phantom{-\\mu\\,S_A}\\\\\n    \\frac{dI_A}{dt} &= \\phantom{B} +\\lambda_A\\,S_A - \\gamma\\,I_A + \\alpha\\,I_J - \\mu\\,I_A\\\\\n    \\frac{dR_J}{dt} &= \\phantom{B - \\lambda_J\\,S_A} + \\gamma\\,I_J - \\alpha\\,R_J \\phantom{- \\mu\\,S_A}\\\\\n    \\frac{dR_A}{dt} &= \\phantom{B - \\lambda_J\\,S_A} + \\gamma\\,I_A + \\alpha\\,R_J -\\mu\\,R_A\\\\\n  \\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow, let’s simulate this model, under the same assumptions about transmission rates as above.\n\n# define the parameters\ndemog_params <- c(0.002, 0.002, 10, 100, 20, 60)\n\n\nja_demog_model <- function (t, x, p, ...) {\n    s <- x[c(\"Sj\",\"Sa\")]                  # susceptibles\n    i <- x[c(\"Ij\",\"Ia\")]                  # infecteds\n    r <- x[c(\"Rj\",\"Ra\")]                  # recovereds\n    n <- s + i + r                        # total pop\n\n    beta1_demog <- p[1]\n    beta2_demog <- p[2]\n    demog_params[3] <- p[3]\n    births_demog <- p[4]\n    alpha <- 1 / c(p[5], p[6]) # alpha = 1/da\n\n    lambda_j <- (beta1_demog + beta2_demog) * i[1] +\n        beta1_demog * i[2]      # juv. force of infection \n    lambda_a <- beta1_demog * i[1] +\n        (beta1_demog + beta2_demog) * i[2]      # adult. force of infection\n    \n    list(\n        c(\n            -lambda_j * s[1] -alpha[1] * s[1] + births_demog,\n            -lambda_a * s[2] + alpha[1] * s[1] - alpha[2] * s[2],\n            lambda_j * s[1] - demog_params[3] * i[1] - alpha[1] * i[1],\n            lambda_a * s[2] - demog_params[3] * i[2] + alpha[1] * i[1] - alpha[2] * i[2],demog_params[3] * i[1] - alpha[1] * r[1],\n            demog_params[3] * i[2] + alpha[1] * r[1] - alpha[2] * r[2]\n        )\n    )\n}\n\nNote that in this function, \\(\\mu=\\) alpha[2], i.e., death, is just like another age class.\n\n## initial conditions\ndemog_yinit <- c(Sj = 2000, Sa = 3000, Ij = 0, Ia = 1, Rj = 0, Ra = 1000)\n\nsol_demog <- deSolve::ode(\n    y = demog_yinit,\n    times = seq(0, 200, by = 0.1),\n    func = ja_demog_model,\n    parms = demog_params\n)\n\n\n7.2.1 Exercise 1: Use this code to plot the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals over time.\n\nplot(sol_demog, mfcol = c(2, 3))\n\n\n\ndim(sol_demog)\n\n[1] 2001    7\n\nhead(sol_demog)\n\n     time       Sj       Sa        Ij       Ia        Rj        Ra\n[1,]  0.0 2000.000 3000.000 0.0000000 1.000000 0.0000000 1000.0000\n[2,]  0.1 1999.378 3003.493 0.4177484 1.352520 0.2039670  999.4835\n[3,]  0.2 1998.175 3006.051 0.9535749 2.096184 0.8716958  999.5051\n[4,]  0.3 1996.047 3006.972 1.7614151 3.444930 2.1911836 1000.5532\n[5,]  0.4 1992.393 3005.091 3.0702863 5.782232 4.5364895 1003.4091\n[6,]  0.5 1986.189 2998.473 5.2419033 9.755376 8.5688796 1009.3604\n\nplot(sol_demog, log = 'y', mfcol = c(2, 3))\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(sol_demog, mfcol = c(2, 3))\n\n\n\npar(mfcol = c(1, 1))\n\nNote that now that births are replenishing susceptibles infection persists.

    "text": "7.3 Getting more realistic: adding more age classes\nIn the models above, the aging process follows an exponential distribution, which means that whether an individual is 1~year old or 10 years old, the chance of them becoming an adult is the same! To improve on this, we can assume that the time a juvenile must wait before becoming an adult follows a gamma distribution. This is equivalent to saying that the waiting time is a sum of some number of exponential distributions. This suggests that we can achieve such a distribution by adding age classes to the model, so that becoming an adult means passing through some number of stages. We’ll use 30 age classes, and since they don’t have to be of equal duration, we’ll assume that they’re not. Specifically, we’ll have 20 1-yr age classes to take us up to adulthood and break adults into 10 age classes of 5~yr duration each. The last age class covers age 66-80.\nNow, when we had just two age classes, we could write out each of the equations easily enough, but now that we’re going to have 30, we’ll need to be more systematic. In particular, we’ll need to think of \\(\\beta\\) as a matrix of transmission rates. Let’s see how to define such a matrix in R. So that we don’t change too many things all at once, let’s keep the same contact structure as in the juvenile-adult model.\n\n# ages_params[1] <- 0.02  #transmission rate\n# ages_params[2] <- 0.01  #transmission rate\n# gamma_ages <- 10\n# births_ages <- 100\n\nages_params <- c(0.02, 0.01, 10, 100)\n\nages <- c(seq(1, 20, by = 1), seq(25, 65, by = 5), 80) # upper end of age classes\n\nda_ages <- diff(c(0, ages))                  # widths of age classes\n\n# set up a matrix of contact rates between classes -- more contact within juveniles and adults than between\nbeta_ages <- matrix(nrow = 30, ncol = 30)    \nbeta_ages[1:20, 1:20] <- ages_params[1] # transmission rate for juveniles \nbeta_ages[21:30, 21:30] <- ages_params[2] # transmission rate for adults\nbeta_ages[1:20, 21:30] <- ages_params[2]/2 # lower transmission rate between juveniles and adults\nbeta_ages[21:30, 1:20] <- ages_params[2]/2 # lower transmission rate between juveniles and adults\n\n#WAIFW stands for Who Aquires Infection From Whom\nfilled.contour(\n    ages, ages, beta_ages,\n    plot.title = title(\n        main = \"WAIFW matrix\",\n        xlab = \"age\",\n        ylab = \"age\"\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll assume that, at the time of introduction, all children are susceptible, as are adults over 45, but that individuals aged 20–45 have seen the pathogen before and are immune. The vector yinit expresses these initial conditions.\n\ndemog_yinit_ages <- c(\n    S = c(rep(100, 20), rep(0, 5), rep(200, 5)),\n    I = c(rep(0, 25), 1, rep(0, 4)),\n    R = c(rep(0, 20), rep(1000, 5), rep(0, 5))\n)\n\nNote that we’re starting out with 1 infected individual in the 26th age class.\nThe codes that follow will be a bit easier to follow if we introduce some indexes that will allow us to pick out certain bits of the yinit vector.\n\nsindex <- 1:30\niindex <- 31:60\nrindex <- 61:90\njuvies <- 1:20\nadults <- 21:30\n\nNow, to capture the aging process, it’s convenient to define another matrix to hold the rates of movement between age classes.\n\naging <- diag(-1 / da_ages)\n\naging[row(aging) - col(aging) == 1] <- 1 / head(da_ages, -1)\n\nHave a look at the aging matrix, for example by doing:\n\n# move fast through the 1-year age classes - negatives are moves out, positives are moves in\naging[1:5,1:5] \n\n# don't age between these classes -- e.g. can't age from 1 to 6\naging[1:5,6:10] \n\n# move slowly between the wider age classes\naging[25:30,25:30] \n\n#plot the aging matrix\nfilled.contour(\n    ages, ages, aging,\n    plot.title = title(\n        main = \"Aging matrix\",\n        xlab = \"age\",\n        ylab = \"age\"\n    )\n)\n\n\n7.3.1 Exercise 2: What can you say about its structure?

We’ll then plot the epidemic curve.\n\nsol_ms <- deSolve::ode(\n    y = demog_yinit_ages,\n    times = seq(0, 100, by = 0.1),\n    func = ja_multistage_model,\n    parms = multistage_params\n)\n\ntime_ms <- sol_ms[, 1]\ninfects_ms <- sol_ms[, 1 + iindex]\n\n\nplot(time_ms, apply(infects_ms, 1, sum), type = 'l')\nlines(time_ms, apply(infects_ms[, juvies], 1, sum), col = 'red')\nlines(time_ms, apply(infects_ms[, adults], 1, sum), col = 'blue')\n\n\n\n\nLet’s mimic a situation where we have cross-sectional seroprevalence data (e.g. measures of antibodies that tell you someone is in the R class). In using such data, we’d typically assume that the system was at equilibrium.\n\n7.3.2 Exercise 3: What does the equilibrium age-specific seroprevalence look like in this example?\nUse the code below to display the age-specific seroprevalence (i.e., the seroprevalence for each age group at equilibrium)\n\nequil_ms <- drop(tail(sol_ms, 1))[-1]\nn_ms <- equil_ms[sindex] + equil_ms[iindex] + equil_ms[rindex]\nseroprev_ms <- equil_ms[rindex] / n_ms\nnames(seroprev_ms) <- ages\nbarplot(height = seroprev_ms, width = da_ages)\n\nLet’s also compute \\(R_0\\). To do so, we’ll need the stable age distribution. We can get that by simulating an infection-free population, which we get by setting the initial I to all 0s:\n\nyinit_sonly <- c(\n    S=c(rep(250,30)),\n    I=c(rep(0,30)),\n    R=c(rep(0,30))\n)\n\nsol_sonly <- deSolve::ode(\n    y = yinit_sonly,\n    times = seq(0, 300, by = 1),\n    func = ja_multistage_model,\n    parms = list(\n        beta_ages = beta_ages,\n        gamma_ages = ages_params[3],\n        births_ages = demog_params[3],\n        aging = aging\n    )\n)\n\ntime_sonly <- sol_sonly[, 1]\npop <- apply(sol_sonly[, -1], 1 , sum)\n\nplot(time_sonly, pop, type = 'l')\n\nAlternatively, we can get the stable age distribution by finding the population structure that balances the birth, aging, and death processes. At equilibrium, we have the matrix equation\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n    -\\alpha_1 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0\\\\\n    \\alpha_1 & -\\alpha_2 & 0 & \\cdots & 0\\\\\n    0 & \\alpha_2 & -\\alpha_3 & \\cdots & 0\\\\\n    \\vdots &  & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n    0 & \\cdots & & \\alpha_{29} & -\\alpha_{30}\\\\\n  \\end{pmatrix} . \\begin{pmatrix}\n    n_1 \\\\ n_2 \\\\ n_3 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ n_{30}\n  \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix}\n    B \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0\n  \\end{pmatrix}=\n  \\begin{pmatrix}\n    0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0\n  \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nTo solve this equation in R, we can do\n\n## get stable age distribution\nn <- solve(\n    aging,\n    -c(multistage_params[[\"births_ages\"]], rep(0, 29))\n)\n\nThe following lines then compute \\(R_0\\) using the next generation matrix method.

    "text": "7.4 R0 and the mean age of infection\nFor simplicity, let’s return to the earlier models with a simple age-class mixing matrix. But this time, we’ll calculate \\(R_0\\), the mean age of infection, and the number of cases between 15-35 years as we increase the rate of contact. Recall from the rubella and CRS example that the risk of severe disease outcomes depends on the risk of infection in reproductive age women. Recall also that increasing vaccination reduces \\(R_E\\) – so here we’ll evalate at several values of \\(R_0\\) as a proxy for the impact of vaccination. We’ll then calculate how the mean age of infection changes, and specifically how the absolute number of cases among individuals between the ages of 15-35 (as a proxy for reproductive age women) changes.

    "text": "7.6 Bonus: Calculating R0 Using a Next Generation Matrix\nThe next generation matrix is a matrix that specifies how many new age-specific infections are generated by a typical infected individual of each age class (in a fully susceptible population). For example, let’s consider an infected adult and ask how many new juvenile infections it generates: this is the product of the number of susceptible juveniles (from the stable age distribution), the per capita transmission rate from adults to juveniles and the average duration of infection, i.e. \\(S_J^* \\times \\beta_{JA} \\times 1/ (\\gamma+\\mu)\\). This forms one element of our next generation matrix. The other elements look very similar, except there are extra terms when we consider an infected juvenile because there is a (very small) chance they may age during the infectious period and therefore cause new infections as an adult:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{NGM} = \\left(\n  \\begin{matrix}\n    \\frac{S_J^* \\beta_{JJ} }{(\\gamma+\\alpha)} +\\frac{\\alpha}{(\\gamma+\\mu)}\\frac{S_J^*\\beta_{JA}}{(\\gamma+\\mu)} &  \n    \\frac{S_J^* \\beta_{JA}}{(\\gamma+\\mu)} \\\\\n    \\frac{S_A^* \\beta_{AJ} }{(\\gamma+\\alpha)} +\\frac{\\alpha}{(\\gamma+\\mu)}\\frac{S_A^*\\beta_{AA}}{(\\gamma+\\mu)} &  \\frac{S_A^* \\beta_{AA}}{(\\gamma+\\mu)}\n  \\end{matrix}\n\\right)\n\\]\n\\(R_0\\) can then be computed as the dominant eigenvalue (i.e., the one with the largest real part) of this matrix.

First, let’s define the components of the next generation matrix:\n\nda_ngm <- c(20, 60) # this classifies the two age groups (0-20, 21-60) \nbeta1_ngm = 0.005\nbeta2_ngm = 0.006\nalpha_ngm <- 1/da_ngm[1]\nmu_ngm <- 1/da_ngm[2]\nn_ngm <- demog_params[4] / c(alpha_ngm, mu_ngm)\n\nbeta_ngm <- matrix(\n    c(beta1_ngm + beta2_ngm, beta1_ngm, beta1_ngm, beta1_ngm + beta2_ngm),\n    nrow = 2,\n    ncol = 2\n)\n\ngamma_ngm = 10\n\nThe Next Generation Matrix can be calculated in R as:\n\nngm <- matrix(\n    c(\n        n_ngm[1] * beta_ngm[1,1] / (gamma_ngm+alpha_ngm) +\n            alpha_ngm / (gamma_ngm+mu_ngm) *\n            n[1] *\n            beta_ngm[1,2] / (gamma_ngm+mu_ngm),\n        n_ngm[2] * beta_ngm[2,1] / (gamma_ngm+alpha_ngm) +\n            alpha_ngm / (gamma_ngm+mu_ngm) *\n            n[2] *\n            beta_ngm[2,2] / (gamma_ngm+mu_ngm),\n        n_ngm[1] * beta_ngm[1,2] / (gamma_ngm+mu_ngm),\n        n_ngm[2] * beta_ngm[2,2] / (gamma_ngm+mu_ngm)\n        ),\n    nrow = 2,\n    ncol = 2\n)\n\neigen(ngm)\n\neigen() decomposition\n$values\n[1] 7.185592 1.592730\n\n$vectors\n           [,1]       [,2]\n[1,] -0.1959422 -0.8584125\n[2,] -0.9806154  0.5129600\n\neigen(ngm, only.values = TRUE)\n\n$values\n[1] 7.185592 1.592730\n\n$vectors\nNULL\n\nmax(\n    Re(\n        eigen(ngm, only.values = TRUE)$values\n    )\n)\n\n[1] 7.185592"

Although unhelpful at the early stages of an epidemic (before the final epidemic size is observed), this method is nonetheless a useful tool for \\({post hoc}\\) analysis. The method is general and can be motivated by the following argument (Keeling and Rohani 2007): First, we assume that the epidemic is started by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. On average, this individual infects \\(R_0\\) others. The probability a particular individual escaped infection is therefore \\(e^{-R_0/N}\\). If \\(Z\\) individuals have been infected, the probability of an individual escaping infection from all potential sources is \\(e^{-ZR_0/N}\\). It follows that at the end of the epidemic a proportion \\(R(\\infty)=Z/N\\) have been infected and the fraction remaining susceptible is \\(S(\\infty)=e^{-R(\\infty)R_0}\\), which is equal to \\(1-R(\\infty)\\), giving\n\\[\n  \\label{R0-estimator}\n  1 - R(\\infty) - e^{-R(\\infty)R_0} = 0\n\\]\nRearranging, we have the estimator\n\\[\n  \\label{R0-estimator-2}\n  \\hat{R_0} = \\frac{log(1-Z/N)}{-Z/N},\n\\]\nwhich, in this case, evaluates to \\(\\frac{log(1-512/764)}{-512/764} = 1.655\\).\n\n9.2.1 Exercise 1\nThis equation shows the important one-to-one relationship between \\(R_0\\) and the final epidemic size.

    "text": "9.3 Linear Approximation\nThe next method we introduce takes advantage of the fact that during the early stages of an outbreak, the number of infected individuals is given approximately as \\(Y(t) \\approx Y_0 e^{((R_0-1)(\\gamma + \\mu)t)}\\). Taking logarithms of both sides, we have \\(log(Y(t)) \\approx log(Y_0) + (R_0-1)(\\gamma + \\mu)t\\), showing that the log of the number of infected individuals is approximately linear in time with a slope that reflects both \\(R_0\\) and the recovery rate.\nThis suggests that a simple linear regression fit to the first several data points on a log-scale, corrected to account for \\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\mu\\), provides a rough and ready estimate of \\(R_0\\). For flu, we can assume \\(\\mu =0\\) because the epidemic occurred over a time period during which natural mortality is negligible. Further, assuming an infectious period of about 2.5 days, we use \\(\\gamma = (2.5)^{-1} = 0.4\\) for the correction. Fitting to the first four data points, we obtain the slope as follows.\n\nmodel <- lm(log(flu[1:4]) ~ day[1:4], data = flu);  #fit a linear model\nsummary(model)         #summary statistics for fit model\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(flu[1:4]) ~ day[1:4], data = flu)\n\nResiduals:\n       1        2        3        4 \n 0.03073 -0.08335  0.07450 -0.02188 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The original report on this epidemic indicates that boys found to have symptoms were immediately confined to bed in the infirmary. The report also indicates that only 1 out of 130 adults at the school exhibited any symptoms. It is reasonable, then, to suppose that transmission in each case ceased once he had been admitted to the infirmary. Supposing admission happened within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. How does this affect our estimate of \\(R_0\\)? Twelve hours?\n\n9.3.2 Exercise 3\nBiweekly data for outbreaks of measles in three communities in Niamey, Niger are provided in the dataframe \\(\\tt niamey\\). Use this method to obtain estimates of \\(R_0\\) for measles from the first community assuming that the infectious period is approximately two weeks or \\(14/365 \\approx 0.0384\\) years.\n\n9.3.3 Exercise 4\nA defect with this method is that it uses only a small fraction of the information that might be available, i.e., the first few data points. Indeed, there is nothing in the method that tells one how many data points to use–this is a matter of judgment. Further, there is a tradeoff in that as more and more data points are used the precision of the estimate increases, but this comes at a cost of additional bias. Plot the estimate of \\(R_0\\) obtained from \\(n=3, 4, 5, ...\\) data points against the standard error of the slope from the regression analysis to show this tradeoff."

Knowing \\(R_0\\) is critical to understanding the dynamics of any epidemic system. It is, however, a composite quantity and is not sufficient to completely describe the epidemic trajectory. For this, we require estimates for all parameters of the model. In this exercise, we introduce a simple approach to model estimation called least squares fitting, sometimes called trajectory matching. The basic idea is that we find the values of the model parameters that minimize the squared differences between model predictions and the observed data. To demonstrate least squares fitting, we consider an outbreak of measles in Niamey, Niger, reported on by Grais et al. 2006 (Grais, R.F., et al. 2006.
